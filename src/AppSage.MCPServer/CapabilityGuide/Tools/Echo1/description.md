# Echo1 Tool 1

The tool is a simple utility that demonstrates how a tool can take user input and return a predictable output.  
Its purpose is to echo back the text provided, prefixed with the another text.  

This is especially useful for testing tool registration, ensuring the MCP server is properly handling input/output, and verifying that prompts and parameter schemas are correctly wired up.
