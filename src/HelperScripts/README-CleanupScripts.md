# Build Artifacts Cleanup Scripts

This directory contains scripts to clean .NET build artifacts and Node.js dependencies from your workspace.

## What Gets Cleaned

The scripts will recursively search for and remove the following directories:
- **`bin/`** folders - Contains compiled .NET assemblies and executables
- **`obj/`** folders - Contains intermediate build files and temporary compilation artifacts  
- **`node_modules/`** folders - Contains Node.js package dependencies

## Available Scripts

### 1. PowerShell Script (Recommended)
**File:** `clean-build-artifacts.ps1`

#### Features:
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core)
- ✅ Detailed progress reporting with colors
- ✅ Size calculation and disk space freed reporting
- ✅ WhatIf mode to preview what would be deleted
- ✅ Verbose output option
- ✅ Error handling and summary statistics

#### Usage Examples:

```powershell
# Clean current directory
.\clean-build-artifacts.ps1

# Preview what would be deleted (dry run)
.\clean-build-artifacts.ps1 -WhatIf

# Clean with verbose output
.\clean-build-artifacts.ps1 -Verbose

# Clean specific path
.\clean-build-artifacts.ps1 -Path "C:\MyProject"

# Combine options
.\clean-build-artifacts.ps1 -Path "C:\MyProject" -WhatIf -Verbose
```

### 2. Batch Script (Simple)
**File:** `clean-build-artifacts.bat`

#### Features:
- ✅ Simple and fast
- ✅ Works on any Windows system
- ✅ Basic progress reporting
- ✅ Folder deletion counter

#### Usage Examples:

```cmd
# Clean current directory
clean-build-artifacts.bat

# Clean specific directory
clean-build-artifacts.bat "C:\MyProject"
```

## Execution Policy (PowerShell)

If you get an execution policy error when running the PowerShell script, you can:

1. **Temporarily bypass for this script:**
   ```powershell
   PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\clean-build-artifacts.ps1
   ```

2. **Set execution policy for current user (one-time setup):**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Important:** These scripts will permanently delete the specified folders and their contents. Make sure you have committed or backed up any important work before running.

✅ **Safe to delete:** The bin/, obj/, and node_modules/ folders can always be regenerated by building your projects or running `npm install`.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Before committing code** - Clean up build artifacts to reduce repository size
- **Disk space cleanup** - Free up space taken by build outputs
- **Fresh build preparation** - Ensure a clean build environment
- **CI/CD pipeline cleanup** - Clean workspace between builds

## Project Structure Impact

After running these scripts:
- .NET projects will need to be rebuilt: `dotnet build` or `dotnet restore`
- Node.js projects will need dependencies restored: `npm install` or `yarn install`
- No source code or configuration files are affected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Access Denied" errors:**
   - Close Visual Studio and any running processes that might be using the files
   - Run the script as Administrator if necessary

2. **PowerShell script won't run:**
   - Check execution policy (see above)
   - Ensure you're using PowerShell 5.1 or later

3. **Some folders not deleted:**
   - Files might be in use by running processes
   - Check for locked files or running applications

### Getting Help:

Run the PowerShell script with `-WhatIf` first to see what would be affected:
```powershell
.\clean-build-artifacts.ps1 -WhatIf -Verbose
```
